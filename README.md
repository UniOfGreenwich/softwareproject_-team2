## 1. Introduction

Phase 3 marks a pivotal stage in our project's development lifecycle, where we transition from design concepts to tangible software solutions. This phase focuses on the meticulous implementation of our system using the C# programming language, coupled with rigorous testing procedures to ensure functionality and reliability.

The adoption of C# as our primary programming language underscores our commitment to leveraging robust tools for software development. Its extensive features and strong typing system provide a solid foundation for translating our design specifications into executable code.

Testing stands as an indispensable aspect of this phase, serving as a critical quality assurance mechanism. Through systematic testing strategies, encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and possibly other methodologies, we aim to validate our software's adherence to specified requirements and its ability to operate seamlessly under diverse conditions.

Central to our workflow is the structured utilization of Git, facilitating collaborative development while maintaining version control integrity. By adhering to branching conventions and merging protocols, we ensure the orderly progression of our development efforts, with all code changes ultimately consolidated into the designated 'phase/3' branch.

To document our progress and facilitate comprehensive understanding, a README.md file will serve as a repository for vital project information. Task assignments, implementation insights, testing methodologies, and outcomes will be systematically documented, providing a clear and informative narrative of our activities during Phase 3

### 3.2 Student and Staff Homepage 

#### Student Homepage
The StudentWindow.xaml is a critical document for developing the WPF library management system (LMS) app. It is the GUI working from the studentâ€™s homepage system of which the application is based. This file displays the interface design, navigation, and implementation of the system, which the users can exploit to accomplish their tasks associated with the features related to managing the account and utilizing the library resources. The main composing elements of this interface is visual including images, labels, buttons, and rectangles allocated to the grid structure to create the front-end in a more user-friendly and visually pleasing manner. This tab includes a search space with a search bar for students to search their chosen books from the library's system. The interface consists of buttons which defining the key options like user's accounts management and books renting. These buttons will always cause needed functions to be executed when clicked on since these corresponding functions are what the event handlers will perform. These, in turn, will facilitate seamless interaction with the system. The navigation elements, which are given the shape of a house, a book and an icon representing the user, respectively, allow the users to easily move around different areas of the app, including those with essential features and functionalities.


To conclude, we might consider our project to be a successful example of modern development practices in application development, a collection of all WPF framework and C# language capabilities, empowering us to create a contemporary and visually appealing library management system with a great user experience.

#### Staff Homepage
