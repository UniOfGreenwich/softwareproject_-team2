## Sequence Diagram
Sequence diagram is a Behavioral Unified Modeling Language (ULM) that is used to show the interactions of the active objects  of the system in a sequential order of them occuring. [[1]](#1) They show the sequence in which interactions take place by showing specific objects, referred to as lifelines, and the messages that flow between them. These diagrams may be used to map out the timing of interactions at various phases of the development process and are useful forsystem design, testing, and maintenance. [[2]](#2)
